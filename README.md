dear teacher.I'm very sorry because I accidentally mistook COMPX234-A4 for A3 when doing assignment4. Therefore, the history of the two assignments is included in my compx213-a3. The history of a3 was last month and that of a4 is this month. Could you please ignore my mistakes and correct my homework twice? Thank you sincerely. please.the A4-client and A4-server is the assignment4,the others is assignment3.
